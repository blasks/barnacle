About Barnacle
==============

Barnacle is a Python package for performing sparse tensor decompositions.
This package depends on the work of many open source projects, particularly 
`Tensorly<tensorly.org>` :cite:p:`kossaifi2019tensorly`, an excellent Python
project for lots of tensor manipulations, including decompositions.
